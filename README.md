## About The Project (Flashcard Generator)
This project is created with mainly Reactjs, In this project  we have three pages,
1) Create Flashcard page 
2) My Flashcard page 
3) Flashcard Details page  with  share page 

- Create Flashcard page: In Create Flashcard page we used a Formik for creating input boxes and for the validation we used Yup

- My Flashcard page: In this section, you can view all the card groups that have been created. Each group is presented with a group heading, an associated group icon image, a description of the card group, the 
                     total count of cards within the group, and a button for accessing the cards on the subsequent page.
  
- FlashcardDetails page: On the page, we wrote a code for displaying the number of cards and details of cards, and on the page, we also created a share popup slide with all social media Links
